**#1 Project Structure**
- Ensure all files in same Directory/Folder (i.e., Smart_Assistant).
- Create a virtual environment(recommended).
- Create a file with name ".env" to store your API_KEY and copy-paste the last line of ".gitignore" file into this .env file.

**#2 Installing Dependencies...**
- Open terminal and ensure the path, then run **pip install -r requirements.txt** to install dependencies.

**#3 Execution...**
- Once Everything is finished, run **app.py** file in terminal to activate Assistant.

- Once it is executed, it will make a sound **"This is Jarvis!"**, the terminal would start printing "Under Your Command Sir"

- Now you need to say **"Jarvis"** to activate the assistant, if activate it will say "Yes Boss", otherwise it will keep on prompting.

**To stop say "shutdown" or press "Ctrl+C"**
