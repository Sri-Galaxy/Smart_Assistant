                                                                **JARVIS - The Smart AI Assistant**
                                                                              

**#1 Project Structure**
- Ensure that all the files are in the same Directory/Folder (i.e., Smart_Assistant).
- Create a virtual environment(recommended) else optional.
- Create a file with name **".env"** to store your API_KEY and copy-paste the last line of ".gitignore" file into this .env file.

**#2 Installing Dependencies...**
- Open the terminal and check the path, then run the command "**pip install -r requirements.txt**" to install all the required dependencies.

**#3 Execution...**
- Once Everything is finished, run this "**app.py**" file in the terminal to activate the Assistant.

- Once it is executed, now it will make a sound **"This is Jarvis!"**, then the terminal would start printing "Under Your Command Sir".

- Now you need to say **"Jarvis"** to activate the assistant, if activated it will say "Yes Boss", otherwise it will keep on prompting.

**To stop say "shutdown"(if activated) or press "Ctrl+C"**
